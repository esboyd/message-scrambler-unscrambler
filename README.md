# message-scrambler-unscrambler

The Scrambler function takes in a message and encodes it in hidden <span> tags in the page's html body. The scrambler also generates thousands of <span> tags containing one random character. The message is therefore hidden from view and random characters are displayed on the page. The scrambler is an object with global scope that can scramble any text any number of times.

The Unscrambler reveals the text in the hidden <span> tags and displays it on the screen.
